# Flowers-Blooming
This project features a beautiful animation of a bouquet of flowers blooming against a night sky, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bouquet includes three unique flowers, with grass and other elements adding dynamic movement. All CSS and JavaScript files are linked to the HTML file, and the project is saved in a GitHub repository.
